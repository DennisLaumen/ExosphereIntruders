# Exosphere Intruders

A pure (i.e. no JQuery or other funky JavaScript frameworks) Javascript and Canvas implementation of the classic video game Space Invaders.

I gave myself the following constraints for this project:

 * Pure JavaScript, i.e. no frameworks, libraries, etc.
 * Pure prototypal inheritance (i.e. differential inheritance) with EcmaScript 5's Object.create() and no constructors, factories, or factory methods. This has a pretty big effect on the code, not always in a good way though (but don't worry, I'm aware of that ;-)). 
 * No static assets like images etc. Pure canvas, baby!

The above constraints lead to some weird code in places. If any JavaScript experts have ideas on how to improve this code within the above constraints. Contact me!

Progress can be tracked on the project's [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/gpKdJ4QU).
